## Specifications
| Test | Input | Output |
|--------|:------:|:-----:|
| **Describe ExchangeService:** |||
| Should correctly return json object if call is successful | standard endpoint | world currency exchange rates |
| Should correctly return error if call is unsuccessful | standard endpoint | error |

Psudo Testing
- user enters the amount of us dollars
- user selects what currency they'd like to exchange to
- user submits info and sees amount converted from USD to selected currency
- if destination currency is not represented, display to user that currency is not avail

to do this I'm going to:
Create an api key
Get api key working in Postman
Make a class for a calculator (ExchangeService) just like my galactic age calculator
Contain a fetch API call 
Import working Exchange Rate calculator into main.js
Create the flow of async operations in main.js
USD amount divided by the Destination Currency exchange rate number euqals the amount of currency in Destination Currency
Create the user input and currency selection in the html
Test the UI
